                            When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. This sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your computer. These are called 'cookies'.</p>

                            These cookies cannot be used to identify you personally and are used to improve services for you, for example through:

                            <li>Letting you navigate between pages efficiently</li>
                            <li>Enabling a service to recognise your computer so you don't have to give the same information during one task</li>
                            <li>Recognising that you have already given a username and password so you don't need to enter it for every web page requested</li>
