              <p class="shout">We are on a mission</p>
              <p>The digital industry has a lot of making up to do. Far too many agencies break their promises, break reputations and worst of all break websites and this is simply unacceptable to us.</p>
              <p>We’ve spent a lot of time researching other web agencies and often they are able to ‘talk the talk’ but fail to deliver on their own manifesto, sometimes even on their own website! We don’t work that way, we always deliver the best, ‘It’ll do’ is not in our vocabulary. If we can’t build it perfectly, we won’t offer it to our clients. We would rather lose money than fail to deliver what we promised.</p>
              <p>We are BBQ and we Build Better Quality as standard.</p>
