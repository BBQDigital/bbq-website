                <p>Quality is a difficult thing to define, however it doesn't have to be abstract. Quality standards have existed for years, except for websites. That's why we put together the <a href="/dsqs">Digital Services Qualty Standard (DSQS)</a>. It is a strict set of quality guidelines which we believe should be a standard across the web. It ensures that your website works for everyone.</p>
                <p>If you want to see if your website meets the DSQS, we now offer a quality audit package for <a href="/order">only &pound;150 + VAT</a>.</p>
